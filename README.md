### Research

I also am a part of a $1.5M Safety Immersion and Gamified Hazard Training (SIGHT) research project at Miami University. Working to develop a web-based AR/VR system to train manufacturing workers on multiple machines using a context aware RAG system. Most of my time spent on this project has been in data cleaning, or Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of legacy pdf manuals.

### Other

Here you will find other projects I have been a part of that are not directly related to my technical skills. One example is the Market Feasibility Study I developed during a consulting program sponsored by EY.
